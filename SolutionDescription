This assignment is a solution for intergalactic calc or merchant guide problem statement.

To run and check if the solution works:
1> please import the project and sbt supported IDE and scala project.
2> Once project is open, go to test folder
3> There is an integration test called "InterGalacticCalcIntegrationTest"
    a> The test reads from an input file in test resource folder
    b> parses the input and checks the output with the expected answers.

Application insight explained as per packages in org.tw.intergalacticcalc
 alienttokens:
    This package contains following domain classes
        Alien language tokens like Glob, Prok, etc.
        Metals like Gold, Silver, etc.
        Also it contains Symbol which is basically Roman Numbers
            Symbol is a type and also contains some basic operations
            Operations like +, -, <, etc.
            Num and Order are type classes implemented by Symbol
        AlienLang and Metal are basically Tokens for the parsing module
 expression:
    This package contains following business/domain
        Expression is a representation of a list of roman numbers
        ExpressionEvaluator as name says it evaluates a given roman expression
            if a Metal present in expression MetalExtractor helps to calculate its cost
            Metal cost once calculated can be used for the evaluation of the expressions
 parser:
    This package contains code to parse user input and apply the calculations
        Parsers object contains all the parser combinators required to parse input
        and extract information like AlienLangToken and Metal
        Also it contains parsers to parse the user queries and give answers.
        TokenRepo is the respository which maintains the mapping of
            metals and their costs
            alien tokens and their roman value

 IntergalacticCalc is a class which acts as a facade, it takes input parses, processes and gives the desired output

 Note: For detailed understanding of the project please refer the Tests.
